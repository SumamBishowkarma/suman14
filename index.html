 I NEVER KNOW THE MEANING OF TRUE LOVE TILL THE DAY I MEET YOU. I ALWAYS BECAME A LILLTLE WEAK WHEN IT COME TO SPEAK IN FRONT OF YOU. I ALWAYS CHEERS EACH AND EVERY MOMENT SPENT WITH YOU.
I THINK I AM THE ONE AND ONLY LUCKIEST BOY INT HE WHOLE WORLD CAUSE I GOT YOU. YOU ARE MORE PRETTY THAN THE SHINING GOLD. I LOVE TO BE CLOSE TO YOU.YOU ARE MORE SWEETER THAN THAN THE CANDY. YOUR VOICE ALWAYS REMINDS ME THAT TIME WHICH WE SOENT TOGETHER.
AND I CANT FORGET THAT LATE NIGHT TALKS AND THE JOKES THAT WE DID TOGETHER. I DONT WANA SEE YOU TROUBLE AND SOME TIME I SATRT TO ANNOY YOU BUT I LOVE TO SEE YOU IN ANGRY MOOD CAUSE YOU LOOK MORE BEAUTYFUL WHEN YOU GET ANGRY. YOUR FACE ALWAYS BRING SMILE IN MY FACE. ALL MY PAIN AND STRESS CHANGES INTO HAPPINESS BECAUSE OF YOU.
YOUR BEHAVIOUR AND HABIT TEACHES ME A GOOD LESSON YOU ARE NOT ONLY A PRITIEST GIRLFRIEND YOU ARE A GOOOD TEACHER TOOO. YOU ARE MY CARE TAKER, MY SUPPOERTER ANY MY EVERYTHING YOUR BEAUTY NEVER STOP GROWING NO MATTER WHAT TIME FOT THE DAY OR NIGHT.
I ALWAYS DREAM ME AS A SKY AND YOU AS A MOON. WHOLE SKY WILL NEVER BE COMPLETED WITHOUT MOON AS LIKE THAT MY LIFE IS IN COMPLETE WITHOUT YOU.</p>
